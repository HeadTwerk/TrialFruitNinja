# TrialFruitNinja
### Trying a fruit ninja-esque game in python

This is a smalll project and good start to learn to make games in python. Since, Python is not huge in the gaming industry, this is a rather free-time project to revise Python
basics in a fun way.

## Requirements:
Python installed on your device (Python3 versions) 

The `pygame` and `random` libraries

And some images of fruits or else you desire
___

# Setting up the requirements
If you don't have Python installed on your device, you can from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Python comes with a package installer `pip`. We can use this to:\
_run theses commands in the command prompt or bash of your device_

Install Pygame:  `pip install pygame`\
Install  random: `pip install random`
___
Now you have the requirements to make the specified game.\
This is a relatively small project but I still recommend and used `pipenv`. It acts as an alternative to `pip` and also
helps to create a virtual environment for your project.\ 
A virtual environment is where all your project files and dependencies can reside un-affected
by any change made to Python installation and its packages later on.
